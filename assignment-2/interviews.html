            <b>First Round (only coding round):</b><br>
            There were four questions in which 2 were easy, 1 was medium and another 1 was difficult.<br>

            1. An array and sum is given to you and you have to find if the sum is in the array or not.<br>
            2. Find the decimal of the binary given.<br>
            3. Frequency of all letters in a string.<br>
            4. And the last one was Queen's problem.<br><br>

            <b>Second Round (Technical 1):</b><br>
            When I was entered the interview room the interviewer did not even let me sit on the chair and he started
            asking questions.<br>
            He asked that do you know searching and tell me its types<br>
            He asked me to write a code of Binary search and given me his laptop and told me to write a program. I just
            wrote it within a minute and it was working well. So he asked to explain that code on a paper and I did
            that.<br>
            Then he started asking about DBMS<br>
            what is DBMS types explanation.<br>
            RDBMS and its product used.<br>
            He asked me to create a many to many table. (Student and Employee) many to many table.<br>
            And queries on it.<br>
            I wrote the queries also.<br>
            Later on he discussed several subjects like OS, Computer Networks but the main focus was on DBMS and
            MySQL.<br><br>
            <b>Third Round (Technical 2):</b><br> I was selected for Technical 2 round and then after an hour I was
            called for Technical 2.<br>
            This was my favorite round as the interviewer was quite frank and friendly and he gave me a development work
            and I did it with full proficiency.<br>
            First he introduced himself and gave me a Computer.<br>
            And asked about my past projects and experiences.<br>
            First of all he started with a problem statement of DBMS that
            There are several employees coming for interviews of students. I need to make a Database to keep record of
            those employees that how many students interviews had they taken. And which student was interviewed by which
            interviewer and for how much time.<br>
            So basically this problem was solved by using Many to Many table formation. And he was impressed by my
            answer.<br>
            Then the best part comes, question that helped to let me push into Third Technical was this :<br>
            He gave me a problem statement to make an application ( It was a game of Snake and ladder which was not that
            easy but still I managed to complete it. I had half an hour to complete it and I completed it in the given
            time).<br>
            Then he started talking to me that what is the company based on and what I am doing right now for livelihood
            and all.<br><br>

            <b>Fouth Round (Technical 3):</b><br> I was sure that I will be selected for this Technical Round 3 and I
            was selected.<br>
            Then the Third round began in which only 3 students got selected and one of them was myself.<br>
            Interviewer was quite strict and started asking about my subjects and previous rounds.<br>

            Then he came to Data Structures. He asked me How will you explain Data Structure to a Noob. Suppose I am a
            Noob then explain me.<br>
            He was impressed from my answer as I have told the definition that was given by sir. Then he asked which is
            my Favorite subject I told Machine Learning as I am familiar with its concepts but he was not. So he again
            asked that which is you favorite subject other than Machine Learning. Then There was a Web Server Project in
            my resume So I said Computer Networks and took him in the direction of My project.<br>
            Then he had given me a problem Statement a Hard problem of LeetCode<br><br>

            Input : ((())))()()()()))) output : ()()()()<br><br>
            There is a string of number of Parenthesis and he asked to find the longest valid substring from it ( not
            the length of substring but substring).<br>
            I wrote code of it in Java using two stacks. I worked out that code in front of him.<br>
            Later he again asked a question that find the Longest valid password from a String then I told him the
            approach of that program and that was correct.<br>
            Then he started asking the Time Complexity of several algorithms and I told everything correctly.<br><br>

            <b>Fifth Round (HR):</b><br> In the HR round, they asked basic questions related to relocation and all.<br>
            Family background<br>
            Achievements<br>
            Asked for higher studies<br>
            Salary expectations : I clearly said my first and last preference is higher package that they are

            I went through a Hackerrank test. It was Completely based on C++.<br>
            Difficulty Level: 9/10 or depends upon knowledge.<br>
            All questions were based on OOPS Concepts, Inheritance, Exception Handling, Pointers, Memory management,
            etc. All were very tricky and not asked straight.
            The coding question was related to operator overloading of &gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt; operators.<br>
            Note: all werent answered correctly.<br><br>

            Then after a few days, I got a call for an interview.<br>
            The interview was held with 3 interviewers.<br>
            Started with a quick introduction.<br>
            Then they directly jumped onto my projects first.<br>
            Then he went through my Hackerrank Solutions which have submitted. Mainly they were focused on those
            questions which were incorrect I corrected a few of them and a few were justified by me.<br><br>
            Q: You have written a web server and mentioned C/C++. How much portion is in C and C++ ?<br>
            Ans: Sir, There is no portion of C in the code. It is a tradition to write C/C++ together thats why I wrote
            it.<br><br>

            Q2) You have learned various languages like C, C++, Java, and Python. Which one will You choose and why
            ?<br>
            Note: The company was looking for a C++ developer. They just wanted to check my knowledge of various
            languages.<br>
            Ans: I would choose Java because it is platform-independent, secondly it manages memory on its own we dont
            need to take care of it. Third, it is an abstraction over a complex library so it is very easy to
            use.<br><br>
            Q3) Now you have mentioned the benefits of Java then why you will work in C++ then ?<br>
            Ans: As C++ is close to the operating system it is very fast, and it is considered the language which is
            closer to the OS will be Faster. If Ill have to work on embedded software then C++ is best. Where java is
            nothing but a wrapper on C++ only, first it will unbox the java code and then compile the C++ code and it
            would take time.<br><br>

            Q4) Do you know about safe pointers ?<br>
            Ans: I asked him Are you talking about smart pointers. He said Yes.<br>
            I Explained the whole answer in detail.<br><br>
            Q5) Difference between TCP/IP and UDP and its benefits.<br>
            Ans: Explained in detail with both pros and cons.<br><br>
            Q6) Do you know the implementation of Shared Pointer ?<br>
            Ans: Answered vaguely.<br><br>
            Q7) Shared pointer is thread-safe or not ?<br>
            Ans: Very typical question it was. Do research about this question.<br>
            I answered this correctly.<br>
            Hint: Do read for Control Block and Managed Block in shared pointers.<br><br>
            Q8) Difference between Regular map and unordered_map in c++ ?<br>
            Ans: Explained correctly its implementation, problems, and thread safety.<br><br>

            Last, they gave me an opportunity to ask questions from them.<br>
            Since one of the interviewer was from Russia,
            I asked Is cryptocurrency going smoothly in Russia, How you are achieving the lower latency in your
            frameworks, and there are many companies in finance and trading, so how yours is different from others ?.
            <br><br>

            After 2.5 hours, I got a call We are having an offer for you.

            and then he asked me a Competitive Programming Question (A hard one)<br>
            He give me only 10 min to solve this question . I solved this question in 4 min, using combination of prefix
            Sum and Hashing technique. He was surprised. He checked my solution and selected me.<br><br>
            <b>Round 4 :</b> This was the final round. It was a technical + HR round and was taken by two interviewers.
            The interviewers asked me to introduce myself. There were questions based on JSP and servlets. questions
            based on the garbage collection and call by value / call by reference and Pointers. Then he told me a little
            bit about the shift details, work structure of ConsultAdd and that time they not tell me my CTC and asked me
            to wait for the offer. Next day they called me and invited me to placement party and gave me the offer
            letters (internship and Full-Time).

            My Profile got shortlisted by one of the recruiters of Paypal.<br>
            <b>Round-1: </b>(Online Assessment) - 1 hour<br>
            It consisted of 2 medium-hard level coding questions that needed to be solved in Java Language only in 1
            hour. Questions were related to Heap and Array. I solved both the questions and I got 100% marks in this
            round.<br><br>

            <b>Round-2:</b> (Technical Interview-1) - 1 hour<br>
            It was 1-hour coding interview round that was focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. I had to write the
            code that should be production ready and should handle all the corner test cases.<br>
            It started with my Introduction. After this, interviewer directly jumped on the coding questions. Firstly a
            warm up question was asked to me.<br>
            1. Warm up question: Given an array, find all the pairs from array which sum up to a given target. I gave
            all the approaches starting from brute force to most optimized one.<br>
            2. Given the root of a binary tree, the value of a target node target, and an integer k, return an array of
            the values of all nodes that have a distance k from the target node. Then I was asked to write the code.<br>
            3. Given a collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a target number (target), find all unique
            combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sum to target. Each number in candidates may be used
            multiple times in the combination. <br>
            I was able to solve both the questions.<br>
            After an hour, I got call that I was selected, and they scheduled my Second Technical Interview on the same
            day.<br><br>

            <b>Round-3:</b> (Technical Interview-2) - 1 hour<br>
            This round was also focused on Data Structures and Algorithms and some follow up questions as well.<br>
            It started with my Introduction. After this, interviewer directly jumped on the coding question.<br>
            1. Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return
            the next greater number for every element in nums. I was asked to write a solution with O(n) time
            complexity. I solved this question using Stack.<br>
            2.Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which
            minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.You can only move either down or right at any point in
            time.<br><br>

            Some more questions that were asked were:<br>
            1. Second Highest salary from the Table (I gave all possible solutions).<br>
            2. 2-3 Queries based on Joins.<br>
            3. Explain SDLC Life Cycle in detail, and which SDLC methodology you prefer and why?<br>

            This Round was taken by the Manager who has 15 years of experience.<br>
            Interview started with my Introduction. Then I was asked to explain projects from my Resume. The interviewer
            was so much impressed by one of my projects (Data Structure Visualizer). I presented that project on my
            system. I was asked to explain the logic behind every functionality in that project. He asked me some follow
            up questions on that.<br>
            1. What technologies you chose and why?<br>
            2. Which SDLC Methodology you followed during project development and why?<br>
            3. Before starting the project, what initial factors did you consider?<br>

            It has one question which we have to solve in 1 hour<br>
            The problem was beautiful path question<br>
            After clearing this round my interview was scheduled after approximately a month<br><br>
            <b>Third Round</b><br>
            In the First Technical Round interviewer asked me to introduce myself,<br>
            then he asked me about my project I explain my digital board and javascript library project,
            then he asked me the approach to solve the problems<br>
            1) an array is not sorted and it has each element occurring twice except one element<br>
            I gave him the brute force approach, then he asked me to optimize it so I gave another approach
            using flag array in which I suggest creating another array of length LargestElement+1 and then traversing on
            the original array
            and increase the value by 1 in flag array on index same as original array element then he told me what will
            happen if array has
            an integer as a max int it will fail<br>
            So he asked me to give an approach that will not use extra space so I gave an approach using Map, then he
            asked me to code this approach<br><br>

            2) the Second problem was, an array is given we have to find the next largest element to each element in the
            array and if the next largest element does not exist in the array it should return -1<br>
            I gave him the brute force approach, he asked me the time complexity and asked to optimize it<br>
            so I gave another approach using stack he asked me to code it<br>
            Then he asked me questions about DBMS like what is ACID properties, joins, the difference in the primary
            key, and unique key
            then he asked me about hashing, hash set, tree set, linear, non-linear data structure<br><br>
            <b>Fourth Round</b><br>
            After passing this round I was invited to the second technical round<br>
            In which interviewer asked me to introduce myself and usage of my project and hardships I faced during
            working on the project
            and what new things I have to learn<br>
            Then he asked me to write code of doubly linked list to add a node in last, add node next to a node, remove
            a node<br>
            I code it and execute the code, then he asked me to write queries of SQL about joins<br><br>

            <b>Fifth Round</b><br>
            It was HR Round In which the interviewer asked me to introduce myself and asked me about my weakness,

            Interview with Zehntech was my first Technical Interview. Before the interview, they gave me 2 programming
            questions. There were 2 Interviewers in my room. The interview started with my introduction, then their
            first question was "Tell me your Weaknesses?", and I was prepared for this question. Then they asked me to
            share an experience regarding my weakness, I gave some examples and with the last example, I grabbed their
            attention toward my project works.
            Then they asked me to explain my project work, â€œWhat are the main features of this application?â€,
            â€œExplain what is layered programming.â€, â€œHow much time does it take to complete this project?â€,
            â€œAsked me to right basic MySQL queries ". I answered them all in 15-20 min.
            Then one of the Interviewer asked me to explain the OPPS concept. I explained in detail about 5-7 min.
            Then he asked me about "Linked list" and "Stack", I answered them very quickly.
            Then they took my answer paper of the 2-question given earlier. Then they asked to explain some specific
            part of one program which was " A basic validation and forming a new string with characters at even
            positions of 2 input strings" and to explain every line of the other program which was "finding all possible
            combinations of a 5-digit number with no repeated digit, not a negativeâ€, which I did by using proper
            sentences.
            Then they asked some basic HR questions as "They asked my home town", "Do you have any problem if change the
            work location?", "How you will manage to travel Ujjain and back to work in time if we are working till late
            at night?", "They asked about my family", I have answered all the questions. In the end, they asked me about
            my hobbies.
            Both the interviewers were friendly with me. I was quite nervous before the interview but while interacting
            with them my nervousness blew away.

            <b>1st Round (1 hour):-</b> based on Datastructures and Algorithms:-<br>

            Firstly interviewer asked about my work, current project, roles, and responsibilities.<br>
            1. Find numbers in an array, whose left element should be less than and the right element should be greater
            than from itself (Write code in any language).<br>
            2. Given a Single linked list with integers, arrange the list in a manner that all the "even" numbers,
            should be at one side of the list and should be sorted in an ascending manner and the next half should only
            contain "odd" numbers sorted in descending manner.<br><br>
            <b>2nd Round (1.5 hours):-</b>
            1. Required to design class and interfaces for a particular feature, in that questions related to design
            pattern and design principles had been asked, It covered all the points of "SOLID" design principles. (You
            were allowed to explain any design principle with your own example at first, then you have to use the
            principle with the given example). This round had been taken by an interviewer with 10+ years of
            experience.<br><br>

            1. Given a list arr[] of everyday temperatures. For each day, the task is to find the count of days
            remaining for the next day with warmer temperatures. If there is no such day for which warmer temperature is
            possible then print -1.<br><br>
            <b>4th Round (2 hours):-</b>
            1. If there is a POJO class "Person" which only has setters and getters and not i wanted to use this class
            as a key in my map, so do we need to write any other methods in my POJO class? If yes, then write those
            additional methods and explain the reason behind writing the methods.<br>
            2. Follow up on the above question, How to sort the List of POJO (Person object) according to their

            I cracked the WIPRO ELITE National Hunt 2022 which is comprised four sections : Aptitude, Logical Reasoning,
            Coding (Python, Java, C, C++), and Essay Writing(100-200 words) . The coding questions were of easy to
            moderate level. After the test I got an email regarding an interview. It was easy and lasted for about 15
            minutes.<br><br>
            Here are the questions that were asked to me.<br>
            1.Tell me about yourself.<br>
            2. Can you elaborate your project in brief as I have mentioned project names in my introduction.<br>
            3. What technologies are you familiar with?<br>
            4. Then she asked me if you have to explain or tell someone what is java who doesnâ€™t have any knowledge of
            java, how will you explain it to them?<br>
            5. Suppose I give you a piece of code Then how will you identify that whether the code has an error or it
            will work properly How will you identify that whether the code has syntax error or if the code doesnâ€™t
            have any syntax error then how will you identify that whether it is logically correct or not?<br>
            6. Why should we do software testing and what are its types?<br>
            7. For how long data is stored in the database?<br>
            8. Tell the time where you have shown your leadership skills?<br>
            9. Tell the time where you were not satisfied with your performance.<br>
            10. Then she gave me a situation that suppose you are a team leader of the project which consists of 4 team
            members and you have to give project report every week to your boss and there is a team member who doesnâ€™t
            have any knowledge of any technology and you have to make everyone equally contribute in project and submit
            the project on time so how will you deal with this situation?<br>
            11. How will you interact with people who are not of your personality?<br>
            12. Are you ready to relocate?<br>
            13. Are you ready to sign the bond?<br><br>

            <b>Round 1 :</b> Technical round 1 based on Data structures and Algorithms<br>

            Questions asked :<br>
            1) Given an array of integers and a number k,you have to find maximum subarray sum of size k from the given
            array.<br>
            I directly jumped to optimized slidling window solution without wasting much time on brute force
            approach.<br>
            2) given an array and a target sum you have to find a pair which can form the target sum and return a
            Boolean value<br>
            This problem was pretty simple and its name is two sum problem it can be done using two pointers,hashmaps
            and set.I have discussed all the solutions one by one with interviewer.<br>
            3) Given a 2d matrix matrix contains 0's and 1's 0 shows position of obstacle and 1 shows a valid position
            in the grid. given a source cell of the matrix you have to count all the paths from source to last cell of
            matrix<br>
            I have came up with a Bottom up Dynamic Programming solution to solve this question.This question was
            similar to Goldmine problem of Dynamic Programming.<br><br>
            <b>Round 2 : </b>It was a Data structures and Java/Springboot/DBMS based round.<br>
            Questions : <br>1)Given an array of 0's,1's,2's you have to sort this array by placing all 0's on the left
            hand side,all 1's in the middle and all 2's at Right hand side<br>
            First I told interviewer regarding 2 pass solution that we can use bucket Sort for this, like counting all
            0's,1's and 2's and spread them in the array itself<br>
            Then interviewer told me to optimize it with single pass solution.<br>
            I told him about the fix 3 pointer solution of this problem which I have rote down before interview. we can
            divide the array into 3 sections and with the help of swap and conditions we can sort the array.<br>
            2) Given a character array of 'U' and 'D' where U denotes we are moving downward from sea level and D
            denotes we are moving upwards.When you will move below the sea level and again come at sea level a valley
            will be formed and similiary when you move above from sea level and comes at sea level again formation of
            mountain takes places.<br>
            You have to count number of valleys formed.<br>
            I told him that We have to maintain array of numbers in which when we will move up we will add 1, will move
            down subtract 1 and once 0 arrived in the array we will assume it's a sea level.so to count valleys we have
            to check how many zeros are arriving in the array such that previous number before 0 is negative.<br>
            This was a tricky problem of hackerrank.<br>
            <b># Java Round</b><br>
            - What is the use of transient keyword in java<br>
            - What is serialisation and how to achieve it.<br>
            - Given a list of employee Objects find employees whom names starts with "A" using stream API's and
            iterators.<br>
            -empty employee list using iterator.<br>
            - What is beans in Spring framework<br>
            -What is value annotation in SpringBoot.<br>
            -Tell me some different annotations of SpringBoot and explain working of them.<br>
            - make a controller class and apply scheduling on that class<br>
            - Difference between post and get<br><br>

            Then he asked me to write a query in MySQL which counts employee departments.<br>
            I told him about group by approach.<br><br>

            <b>Round 3:</b><br>
            1)Best sorting algorithm in terms of worst case complexity<br>
            2)Write code for merge sort and merge 2 sorted list.<br>
            3) Detect cycle in a linkedin list.<br>
            I told him about set approach as well as the tortoise 2 pointer algorithm.<br>
            4) discussion on some terms of Multithreading and concurrency.<br>
            Write a code such that you have to create two thread one will be the main thread and one will be some
            parallel thread.You have to print bbb from the parallel thread and aaa from the main thread.<br>

        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">

            I will be working remotely at a San Francisco based startup founded by Netflix Engineering Managers. So
            interview was taken by them.<br><br>
            There were 3 rounds of interview.<br>
            <b>First round</b> - This round was basically to check if I can really code and not lying in my resume. So,
            basically in the first round they did review of my Leetcode and Github profiles and asked few questions and
            we were done within 15-20 mins.<br><br>
            <b>Second round</b> - This round was real deal, interviewer asked about my experience and skills overall. I
            told them about what I did at Thinking Machines (starting with C, C++ to J2ee using Tomcat, and all the way
            to Springboot) and Internship at Kuliza Technologies (where I created library for 3rd party APIs which can
            be integrated quickly in a Fintech product and reduced Kuliza's delivery time by at least 60 days).<br>
            I had created backend projects in java using both Monolithic and Microservice based architectures, following
            questions were asked regarding them.<br>
            1. Which architecture is better and why?<br>
            2. Why Java Springboot for these projects?<br>
            3. What design patterns you used, and why? Cross question why not this design pattern? (y'all are very lucky
            to have a dedicated course on System Design and Design Patterns from sir).<br>
            4. How do you communicate among microservices?<br>
            5. When to scale a microservice and when not to scale?<br>
            6. In the project, I had used some Netflix open source tools like Eureka Discovery Server and Zuul Proxy,
            some questions regarding them.<br>
            7. Challenges faced while creating this project and what else you would like to improve.<br>
            8. Favourite maven dependency (maybe he wanted to create some humour or maybe he ran out of questions).<br>
            After interview, I asked him some questions about his experience at Netflix and my roles, responsibilities
            and expectations from me.<br><br>
            <b>Third round</b> - HR round<br>
            This round was typical HR round. Explaining culture, vision, DOs Donts and salary discussion.

        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            Recruitment process was held in 2 phases.<br>
            <b>1. Online Coding Round (3-hours):</b><br>
            There were 2 coding questions of having easy-medium difficulty level.<br><br>

            A) Two strings are considered "almost equivalent" if they have the same length AND for each lowercase letter
            x, the number of occurrences of x in the two strings differs by no more than 3. There are two string arrays,
            s and i, that each contains n strings. Strings s[i] and t[i] are the ith pair of strings. They are of equal
            length and consist of lowercase English letters. For each pair of strings, determine if they are almost
            equivalent.<br><br>

            Example:<br>
            Input:<br>
            s=['aabaab','aaaaabb']<br>
            t=['bbabbc','abb']<br><br>

            Output:<br>
            YES<br>
            NO<br><br>

            B) There are n people standing in a queue for a metro train numbered from left to right, 1 to n. Each person
            has a tolerance limit p and will only wait until the time p expires. If the train reaches after time p, the
            person will leave the queue and miss the train. Initially, the train is empty and has a fixed capacity k.
            Given a number of queries q, where each query is a time of train arrival, q[i], for each query, print the
            index/number (1-indexed) of the kth person who catches the train. If all passengers remaining in the queue
            can board the train, return 0 because there will be no kth person.<br><br>

            For example, given a train with capacity k = 2, tolerance limits of p= [1, 2, 3, 4], and queries at times q
            = [1, 3, 4], there are three scenarios all dealing with the same initial queue. Where the train arrives at
            q[0] = 1, all passengers are still queued but only the first two will fit on the train. The last passenger
            who will fit is number 2. If the train arrives at q[1] =3, passengers 1 and 2 have left the queue, the first
            two remaining (3 and 4) get on the train, filling it to capacity. When q[2] = 4, passengers 1, 2 and 3 have
            left, so passenger 4 can get on. Since the train is not filled, there is no kth passenger. The returned
            array of answers is [2, 4, 0].<br><br>

            <b>2. Non-Technical Assessment:</b><br>
            In this assessment there were pre recorded videos which contained HR Questions.

            My interview experience was good and not tough though.<br>
            I applied for the internship from intern Shala and there were only 2 questions that had to be completed
            before applying.<br>
            Q1: Print all possible combinations of string.<br><br>
            Q2: Traverse a BST level-wise without recursion.<br><br>
            Then after a few days of submission, I got a call for an interview with the CTO of the company.<br>
            So, I would like to provide the key points as follows:<br>
            It started with the basic questions about my place of living and college.<br><br>
            Then he asked me:-<br>
            Q1): You have given a quadratic equation(ax^2+bx+c) and you have to find values of a, b, and c such that the
            root will always be an integer.
            I took time to solve this question because I haven't given any values of x and a, b, c.<br>
            This question was just to check my math fluency. Then he told me his approach " we can assign an integer
            value to x and then we can generate the values of a, b, and c."<br><br>

            Q2): Reverse a linked list in a single iteration?<br>
            Ans: I just completed my half answer and he went to the next question.<br><br>

            Q3) Find the middle of the linked list in a single iteration?<br>
            Ans: I told him the method using a fast pointer and a slow pointer.<br><br>

            Q4): Find 50% of the linked list?<br>
            Ans: This question was just to check the awareness. I answered him " we have already discussed this question
            now." Then he forwards to the next question.<br><br>

            Q5) Traverse 80% of the linked list in a single iteration?<br>
            Ans: My first method was inefficient, then I told him the optimized way. But he also told me to do this in
            another way. I told, "We can move slow pointer 4 times and fast pointer 5 times, but it will fail when the
            then linked list will be shorter."
            He then satisfied these answers. now, last but not least.<br><br>

            Q6) You have been given two containers of 3 liters and 5 liters and you have to measure only 4 liters.<br>
            Ans: I took time but when I started explaining the answer, he told me to mail him the solution.<br><br>

            I mailed him my solution and the next day I got a call.<br>
            "You are selected ..!"<br><br>
            Although, I am selected still I am working on my communication because this is just the beginning and I want
            to work with the most experienced people in the future.<br>

            <b>Round 1 : Online Assessment</b><br>
            There were 2 coding questions in this round.Both were medium level question.I solved them both completely.I
            was asked to write
            explanation about the time complexity and algorithm used.
            Then I got the mail that you are selected for the interview rounds.Then there were 3 Interviews scheduled on
            the same day.
            <br><br>
            <b>Round 2 : Technical Interview</b><br>

            First I was asked a question based on their leadership principles.We had a discussion about my story for 10
            to 15 minutes and then the
            interviewer jumped on to coding questions.There were two questions asked which were:<br>
        </p>
        <div style="padding:5px;background:#aaaaaa;color:black;font-size:12pt">
            1) Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.<br>
            The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being
            repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.<br>
            You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are
            well-formed, etc.<br>
            Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for
            those repeat numbers, k.<br>
        </div><br>

        <div style="padding:5px;background:#aaaaaa;color:black;font-size:12pt">
            2) Given a 2D grid of characters and a word, find all occurrences of the given word in the grid. A word can
            be matched in all 8 directions at any point. Word is said to be found in a direction if all characters match
            in this direction (not in zig-zag form).
            The 8 directions are, Horizontally Left, Horizontally Right, Vertically Up, Vertically Down and 4 Diagonal
            directions.
        </div><br>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            I gave the brute force approach in both of the questions and then the interviewer asked me to optimize
            it.<br>
            We also had discussion about the time and space complexities.
            <br><br>
            <b>Round 3 : Technical Interview</b>&gt;<br>

            The interviewer quickly jumped to the coding questions.There were 2 coding questions which were:<br>
        </p>
        <div style="padding:5px;background:#aaaaaa;color:black;font-size:12pt">
            1) Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water). An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected
            group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.
            <br>
            Return the number of closed islands.
        </div><br>

        <div style="padding:5px;background:#aaaaaa;color:black;font-size:12pt">
            2) Given an array of integers. Find a peak element in it. An array element is a peak if it is NOT smaller
            than its neighbours. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour.
        </div><br>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            I solved the first question very quickly but was asked to optimize the space complexity which I did and then
            the interviewer
            gave me the second question I gave an approach then told the interviewer I can optimize it and then we had a
            long
            discussion about the second approach.They also ask you why you are using this algorithm and what are the
            benefits.Then
            the interviewer asked me a question based on leadership principle.
            <br><br>
            <b>Round 4 : Hiring Manager Round</b><br>

            At first the interviewer asked me questions based on Java and OS.Then he asked me a leadership question and
            we had a discussion about my story for 30 mins.He asked me every small detail he could have asked. He was
            also writing whatever I was telling him.
            Then at last he asked me to implement Binary Search and asked me to dry run and explain the code.
            <br><br>
            <b>Round 5 : Bar Raiser Round</b><br>

            This round is one of the most important round.The interviewer had 10+ years experience.First he asked me two
            leadership based questions we had a disccussion
            about it for some time.Then he asked me a coding question in which there was a worker at x,y location and
            then there are m pickup locations given to you
            .You need to find the nearest pickup location.I gave O(m) approach with which he was satisfied then asked me
            what will you do if there are obstacles in between.
            Then I gave another approach and he was satisfied with it.Then there were 10 minutes still remaining so I
            asked him couple of questions about his work and his experience
            and we had a healthy discussion about it.

            For every question I had to write complete code and the code should be production ready.They ask you every
            small detail about everything.
            After a week I got reply from amazon that I have been selected for sde 1 role.

            that needs to be done in 25 minutes. The one who clears this round would get the chance to appear in the
            coding round.<br><br>

            The coding round consisted of 2 questions that needs to be coded to pass all the available and hidden test
            cases in 90 minutes. Top performers from this round would get the call for appearing for the interview
            rounds.<br><br>

            I gave 2 technical and 1 managerial interview, all in a single day. The technical interview focused mainly
            on core and in-depth knowledge of Java. I was also asked to code certain questions, that includes, find the
            Kth largest number from the given set of numbers, print the level order, In order and zig zag order
            traversal for a binary tree. Each question had a follow up question on complexity and ways to optimise it.
            The rest was on different core concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, singleton class,
            multithreading.<br><br>

            As the part of technical rounds, I was asked a couple of puzzle questions similar to the 12 coins problem
            and water bucket problem. There was a huge discussion upon the projects I mentioned on the resume as well.
            Each technical round was an elimination round. After clearing both of the technical rounds, I got the
            managerial round.<br><br>

            The managerial round was all about the behavioral questions and a couple of puzzle questions to see the
            approach of problem solving.<br><br>

            After giving the rounds, I got the final mail within 24 hours stating that I have been selected for the SDE
            - 2 role.<br><br>

            resume got shortlisted.<br><br>

            They asked me to give an IQ test on an android app and send them the screenshot of the result. A day later I
            got a mail for technical test, the technical test was consist of four phases, all were easy.<br>
            Phase 1 was logical reasoning mcqs.<br>
            Phase 2 was an incomplete PHP Code. It was an arithmetic operation related program with a character as
            which-operation-to-perform.<br>
            Phase 3 was debugging a JavaScript Code which was related to Generator Concept in JavaScript.<br>
            Phase 4 was again an incomplete PHP Code where I needed to define a small class.<br><br>

            Next day I got a mail for an interview where he asked me<br>
            Q : Why I chose PHP as a Programming Language?<br>
            A : I clearly stated that because its syntax is similar to C++.<br>
            Q : Have you ever used AWS?<br>
            A : I said no but I added that it wouldn't be difficult to learn because it's just an API that has a certain
            documentation and some methods to call for our work.<br>
            Q : How database works?<br>
            A : I said it is just a File Handling code and explained it.<br>
            Q : Have you ever created an application without any server?<br>
            A : I said an Inventory Management System with File Handling because in the end of every project I made, a
            server came into the picture, either it was with socket programming or with database support.<br>

            I got shortlisted through eLitmus.<br><br>

            <b>First Round :</b> It was an MCQ test where you have to solve 30 questions in 25 minutes. All the
            questions were based on C++. It contained questions related to basic C++ concepts like classes, inheritance,
            polymorphism and some questions were related to advanced concepts like threads, synchronization, File
            handling, etc.<br><br>

            <b>Second Round :</b> It was a technical round. The interviewer asked about all the concepts of c++ and
            oops. He wanted me to explain all the concepts by writing code.<br>
            You can refer to all the c++ topics which are taught in the c++ course because that's what helped me to
            explain all the concepts through codes.<br>
            Then he asked me to solve a data structure problem (Remove a given value from a linked list). For data
            structures, they generally ask standard questions of linked lists and BST.<br>
            Then he asked me some questions related to OS like:-<br>
            What are semaphores and mutex?<br>
            What is a deadlock?<br>
            Then he asked if I know Linux, I told him I only know some basic commands of Linux<br>
            So he asked me what is kill command.<br>
            So this round went for about 75 minutes for me where he covered almost all the concepts of c++.<br><br>

            <b>Third Round :</b> He told me since my first round went pretty well, So he didn't ask any basic
            questions.<br>
            He asked me What is a thread?<br>
            What happens to all the threads if the main process is killed?<br>
            Difference between a web-based application and a network-based application.<br>
            This round only went for like 20 minutes.<br><br>

            <b>Fourth Round :</b> This round was a managerial round.<br>
            In this, the interviewer was basically going through my resume and asked me questions about that.<br>
            Since I have mentioned 2 C++ projects in my resume, he asked me to explain those projects.<br>
            Then he also asked me some questions related to C++ like<br>
            Explain examples of polymorphism<br>
            What is a template and why we use it?<br>
            What data type will you use to store a complex number in c++?<br>
            This round also went for about 30 minutes.<br><br>

            Then the last round was the HR round, where they just discuss the offer, position, your interests, etc.<br>
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:18pt;font-weight:bold;color:#004085;text-align:justify">
            You just have to keep all the basics of c++ and oops very strong and should be able to explain them to the
            interviewer by writing codes.<br>

            Asked about Industrial training.<br>

            About Major Project (I told my role, description of the project along with challenges faced, and how I
            overcome them)<br>

            Which language do you prefer especially for development? - I said Java.<br>

            Is online learning beneficial? - I gave a positive reply.<br>

            Asked about most and least favourite subject - I said DS favourite and least favourite EDC (then some random
            discussion on same)<br>

            Then he started asking questions from various subjects (some questions/topics which I remember were):<br>

            3.) Data Structures:<br>

            Sorting algorithms and types, How many you are comfortable with? Write code of anyone, Find the time the
            complexity of code you wrote, How to choose the best algorithm for sorting? Why is quick sort good over
            merge sort, Questions from Collections (very important), Trees and their types explanation (BST, AVL, etc.),
            Graphs, Real World application of trees and graphs (name some algorithms used there), ArrayList vs
            LinkedList which to use where and why?<br>

            4.) Java:<br>

            OOPs (I explained every concept with real-life example and then relating it to technical aspect), Memory
            management in Java, Abstract classes and Abstract methods, Interfaces, Can we extend from a class and
            implement multiple interfaces at the same time? (answered yes), Compiler vs Interpreter with an example of
            languages using them, Recursion with an example, Java 8 advancement.<br>

            5.) Apart from the code of sorting algorithms, he asked the program to find prime numbers then asked to
            change the code for finding prime numbers between 1 to 100.<br>

            I cleared this round and in the next half hour, there was TR-2.<br><br>

            For many, the essay writing section of ELITE Talent Hunt proves to be the reason of rejection in the first

            technologies that were used. The discussion on the projects was around 20 minutes long and the whole first
            round of interview lasted for about 1 hour 15 minutes. After 10 minutes of completion of the first round of

        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            There was 1 coding assessment, 3 coding rounds (2 for mine) followed by an HR round.<br><br>

            <b>Round 1(Technical Assessment - Coding Round):</b>Â&nbsp;There were 3 technical coding questions that were
            to be solved within 1.15 hrs.<br>
            Question level - Medium/Hard<br>

            Write the word representation for any number ranged from 1-100<br>
            Question based on Bitwise Operator (Formula Based)<br>
            Question third was hard and pattern based.<br>
            I have completed 2/3 Question completely and selected for Technical Interview.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Round 2(Technical Interview - Level 1) : </b>Medium<br>
            The round kickstarted with a nice round of introduction followed by some OOPs concepts and project
            explanation. Then, we directly jumped on coding questions by sharing a google doc. The coding questions were
            not directly Leet Code or GFG questions but, a slight variation to all those problems.<br>
            <br>
            They gave me 3 medium level Questions in google Doc<br>
            1.Common Substring in start end and between substring.<br>
            2.Tree based question : Rotation of tree through any node.<br>
            3.Rotating a string clockwise or anticlockwise.<br>

            He also gave their own compiler link where I had to code this . I have completed both these questions for
            all the various inputs they had given.<br>

            I completed the interview. The interview went slightly ahead of 1hr.<br>
            Waited for 3 long days, I received my results in my mail that I am selected for the next Technical Round
            2.<br><br>


            <b>Round 3 - (Technical Discussion - Level 2) :</b> Medium - Hard<br>

            This round also kickstarted with a good intro and some basic DBMS ,OS and OOP's concepts.<br>
            Also they questioned me about HashMap working and collisions and basic Collection classes questions.<br>
            Next we had a project discussion in which they asked various things like Implementation ,Technologies used,
            difficulties faced, and how you resolved them ( depends upon your project).<br>
            I explained all these things very nicely.<br>
            Then next is System Design thing in which they give me a task to design an Online Food Delivery Management
            System. Basically first we have to design all the necessary actions (Basic) and tables in 10 minutes.<br>
            Then next they asked me a complex query related to this system. I answered all this and interviewer seems
            impressed.<br>
            After that they asked me what data structure will you use for implementation?<br>
            Also write the code for implementation.<br><br>

            Next thing the interviewer gave 1 problem (Some variation to Rod-cutting Problem) based on DP The
            interviewer only needs approach for this.<br>
            It was a medium round.<br>
            Waited for 2 long days, I received my results in my mail that I am selected for the next HR Round.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Round 4(Hiring Manager Round):</b> Very Easy<br>

            It included a total of 4 rounds.<br>
            <b>Round 1 :</b> It was a coding round, where you have complete two questions in 60 mins. The questions were
            of medium difficulty, one was of a string, and the other was of array manipulation. I solved both the
            questions.<br>
            <b>Round 2 :</b> In the second round, the interviewer first asked the basic questions about java, oops, os,
            ds and asked for an overview of all my projects which I mentioned in the resume. After that he asked some
            sql queries. The interview went for about 30 minutes.<br>
            <b>Round 3 :</b> This round was scheduled with a senior developer. He just gave a coding question and asked
            me to solve it.<br>
            - Find all the pairs in the array whose sum is equal to the given value. (Asked me to write the optimized
            approach)<br>
            I solved this question. After this, he again gave me a problem to solve.<br>
            - I don't specifically remember the question, but it was related to generating combinations of a string with
            some conditions given.<br>
            After solving these questions he told me to run with testcases.<br>
            Then he went to my resume and started asking questions about my projects.<br>
            My first project was -HTTP based web server in c++<br>
            He asked questions in deep about what is a socket?<br>
            what are TCP/IP layers and HTTP?<br>
            what is the structure of response in HTTP?<br>
            My next project was Remote File System<br>
            In this also he asked many questions - Why using HTTP protocol instead of FTP ?<br>
            What are semaphores and why you used them?<br>
            Then he asked for some basic java, os, data structures, SQL, and so on.<br>
            This round went for about 60 mins.<br>
            <b>Round 4 :</b> This round was with the engineering lead of the company. It was not a pure technical
            round.<br>
            He first asked me questions related to my project.<br>
            Like, explain your projects and their purposes.<br>
            And it just like a discussion where I was just explaining to him about the projects and he was asking
            questions in between.<br>
            After this, he gave me two puzzles to solve. I managed to solve both the puzzles. (There is a puzzles
            archive on geeks for geeks, I practiced some from there and it helped me.)<br>
            After this round the next day I received the selection mail.<br>
            The overall experience was good. You have to keep your basics strong, should be able to explain your
            projects properly, and should be prepared with the cross-questioning while explaining the projects.<br>

            I gave TCS NQT.The test had 5 sections namely Verbal Ability, Reasoning ability, Numerical Ability,
            Programming Logic and Coding. The questions in every section were very basic but tricky. So if someone is
            clear with basics and give the test with concentration he can clear the test easily.<br>
            The interview consisted of three rounds- Technical Round, Managerial Round, HR Round. All of these rounds
            were taken simultaneously as there were three persons in the meeting and all were asking their domain
            related questions. Some of the questions were:<br>
            Give a brief Introduction of yourself.<br>
            Explain any one of your projects.<br>
            What was your role in that project?<br>
            Why is java platform independent?<br>
            What is the use of try-catch in java?<br>
            Have you heard about APIs?<br>
            What is error handling?<br>
            What are DDL commands?<br>
            What is the difference between drop , delete and truncate?<br>
            Some information on some tables was provided and I was asked to write a query(That was to be done using join
            operation).<br>
            How will you manage if there is a conflict between your team members?<br>
            Where do you see yourself in next 5 years?<br>
            Will you reallocate if the covid situation gets normal?<br>
            And some more similar HR questions.<br>
            After a few days I received a mail for my selection and then after for offer letter.<br>
            After some days I received a mail for an opportunity to upgrade my ninja offer to digital offer by giving
            digital capability assessment(DCA).<br>
            It consisted of 2 coding questions. The questions were basic but lengthy. Anyone with a little coding
            experience can code for those questions easily.<br>
            I solved both the questions and received my updated offer letter without any interview.<br>
            But solving both the questions doesn't guarantee the clearance of test. Some of my friends solved both the
            questions but they received a mail that they had not cleared DCA. Also interviews were conducted for the
            next shift of DCA so prepare well.<br>

            <b>Round-1 :</b>
            In the first round, I had a conversation with the CEO wherein we mainly discussed my skillset and projects.
            It started with a quick introduction, and he further wanted to know when and how I developed an interest in
            Programming and why I chose this line of study.<br>
            He dived into questioning around the HTTP Webserver Project, why I chose to build a webserver based on HTTP
            and not some different protocol, the various protocols in use.<br>
            He further asked me about my experience with Python. I mentioned the Network Application and Remote File
            Accessing server. He briefly touched the latter and wanted me to share the code with him.<br>
            Some other questions:<br>
            1. Explain what is a Socket in layman terms<br>
            2. Explain what is an API in layman terms<br>

            Questions from this round:<br>
            1. Define various Protocols, Why TCP is used under HTTP, HTTP vs UDP, Ports for HTTP and HTTPS<br>
            2. He pointed to the code and asked about the meaning of SOCK_STREAM and AF_INET. He was satisfied with my
            answer and further asked me to define the various Socket Types and Address Families. I was thorough with the
            same and explained it to him.<br>
            3. He noticed that I used Semaphore in the Remote File Access server code and asked me to explain the same.
            I defined it along with its actual life application.<br>
            4. Types of Inheritance<br>
            5. new operator, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Pointers.<br>
            Questions based on DSA (He mainly wanted to see my approach and didn't demand an exact code):<br>
            1. Split the given Strings by spaces, group equal length valid strings and print the result in ascending
            order of string length.<br>
            2. Implement a Binary Search Tree (Pseudocode) and questions around the operations on the same.<br>
            -&gt;Make sure that while coding the solution, you Discuss your approach out loud. Keep explaining what each
            line of code is supposed to do, so as to keep the interviewer engaged. And answers to theoretical questions
            be backed by real-life examples.<br>

            <b>Round-3:</b>
            The final round was with the CTO.<br>
            We exchanged introductions, and since I added GitHub links to all of my projects in my resume, he dived in
            straight to the code of the HTTP web server. Asked me to explain the purpose of each class, method and
            property. Then hed randomly point to some lines of code and ask me to explain what the snippet will do. He
            also wanted to know why I implemented every method from scratch and avoided additional built-in
            libraries.<br>
            He asked me to define a Linked List, and tried to Trick me with a question on the same along the lines of
            pointers and Operator overloading.<br>
            To make sure if I am a good culture fit for the organization, he asked me a few general questions: what
            motivates me, what am I looking for in this Internship, and briefed me about what Ill be primarily working
            on once onboard.<br>
            He wrapped up the Interview with 2 DSA questions: Determine if a Linked List is merged (A classic Leetcode
            Problem) and Another Question based on Hashing.<br>
            -&gt;Keep your basics strong and Know your Code well.<br><br>

        <p style="font-size:18pt;font-weight:bold;color:#004085;text-align:justify">
            I received positive feedback on all three rounds and two days post the last round received the confirmation
            that they wish to have me onboard.

            2. Technical interview<br>
            3. HR interview<br>
            At First I submitted resume for shortlisting. There was no mail or call for the purpose that my resume has
            been shortlisted. After 3-4 days from the day of submission of resume there was a call from HR and that call
            was itself the telephonic round.<br>
            <b>Telephonic Interview :</b><br> They asked few questions on linked list, stack, queue and trees. Then he
            said tell me something about yourself and your skills so that I can ask more questions. For that I gave a
            brief intro. Since in that intro I have also mentioned Data Structures and Algorithms in my skills, Further
            questions were on complexities of different operations of data structures. Randomly taking interview gives
            them idea that whether the candidate really knows the skills what he has mentioned in his resume, according
            to what said by HR.<br>
            <b>Technical Interview :</b><br> It started with brief intro and then asked for programming languages that I
            know. My answer was C, C++, JAVA, PYTHON. Then he asked for the projects that I have worked on. I enlisted
            all the projects that I have added in my resume with brief explanation and technologies used in each. In one
            of the projects I have also mentioned the technology used as itext5. So there was a small discussion about
            what It does and what I have created using it. Then he asked me that do you know react ? My answer was 'No,
            I don't know but It is the part of course that I am currently doing'. He said it's not a major issue and
            continued further with JAVA questions on Anonymous class, static variable and method, initialiser block and
            static initialiser block, memory allocation for static variable and execution sequence, and access
            specifiers. Then there were two programming questions and two puzzles to be solved and give explanation.
            Then the questions were on constructors in java. Then there were questions on String and one of the
            questions he asked was having a line<br><br>
            String s="Hello";<br><br>
            While answering the question I intentionally said the complete process "that heap of string objects is
            maintained ..." as taught by sir. He got really impressed when I wrote some examples proving the
            explanation. Since the explanation has heap data structure, there were some questions on heap. Next question
            was how much part of web development have you completed. Accordingly they asked basic questions on
            javascript.<br>
            <b>HR interview :</b> It was just after TR interview. It took place for just about 5-10 minutes and asked
            some behavioural questions.<br><br>
            After 2 days There was a call that you have been selected and stipend will be Rs. 15000/- month. He also
            said that as per your interview performance and performance of your next 4 months we will also offer you
            full time.

            I had applied for this company through LinkedIn. The role is of Java Developer. CTC or Annual package wasn't
            mentioned for this role, but then also I had applied.<br>

            <b>Round 1 : </b><br>
            They had mailed me the link of a coding assessment. This coding assessment consisted of 4 questions which
            were to be coded in Java only. The duration of assessment was 1.5 hour. I completed all questions within
            stipulated time. In 2 questions, I had made use of Collection Classes as it was a necessity.<br>

            <b>Round 2 : </b><br>
            After clearing first round, they asked me to give a second asssessment. Like previous assessment, this
            assessment also consisted of 4 questions and duration was 1.5 hours. But, the questions were quite
            difficult. I had done only 3 questions which required use of Collection Classes. The question which I was
            not able to code, was related to clock and time.<br>

            <b>Round 3 : </b><br>
            Round 3 was a technical round where 2 interviewers were there. The interview was held on Microsoft teams.

            Questions on these topics were asked - "Significance of keywords - public, static, void and main, Compiler
            V/s. Interpreter, StringBuffer V/s StringBuilder, concepts of object oriented programming, collection
            hierarchy, Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList, SQL queries related to join and group by. This phase
            of interview was completed in 15 minutes. Then, he had opened up few codes that I had written in the first 2
            rounds. He asked me that why I had written code in that manner. He had also made manipulations in my code
            and asked me to predict the behaviour or output of the code. The whole interview lasted for 35 minutes.<br>

            <b>Round 4 :</b><br>
            This was the HR round which was taken by 2 interviewers - one was from Australia and another was from Sri
            Lanka. This interview was basically a Whatsapp Video Call. They asked me to introduce myself and what do I
            know about the company? Then, they also told me about the company and how they work. After that, only
            general talk was there. In this round itself, they disclosed the annual package of 4 LPA.<br>

            Find the unique element?<br>
            Problem 2 : inverse module(What is it, How to find in efficiently, When it doesn't exist)<br>
            Problem 3 : Trapping rain water problem?<br>
            Then she asked questions based on CS Fundaments. Some of them were related to OS like what is locking,
            semaphore, deadlock.<br>
            RDBMS : 3 queries based on aggregate function, order by, based on multiple condition<br>

            the binary tree. What is REST API. How to make REST API. GET and POST request, their difference and uses.
            Which is more secure. I was asked how to make REST API. I answered I only know the basics of web-dev, then
            he turned his laptop towards me and said search and you have 5 min to read. I searched but couldn't
            understand much. Meanwhile, as I was searching for answer he told me you can't know everything so thats how
            you will be doing in the industry. Search/ask study and implement if you don't know something. But your
            search and way of finding things should be fast and efficient.<br><br>
            <b>Personal thoughts :</b> Overall my experience with the interview was good. Even though I didn't make any
            cool/mind-blowing project I believe I was selected(2 were selected out of 87) because of my confidence,
            strong basics and problem solving, data structure and algorithms, displaying my passion for programming and
            technology, hunger to learn and a little bit of luck also.

        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            <b>Written Test :</b> Consist of two sections
            i) Cognitive skills (30 questions 30 minutes)-&gt; level intermediate<br>
            ii) Technical sections( 1 Hour)-&gt; 4 coding questions -&gt; level intermediate<br>
            All four questions are basically on array and string manipulation and one is series based.<br>
            like: if a number comes in Fibonacci series then print it else print -1 .<br>
            <b>Technical Interview 1 : </b> (within one or two days)-&gt; After clearing round one I had a technical
            interview which is as follows:<br>
            i) Introduce yourself.<br>
            ii) How will you rate yourself in Java (As I mentioned java as my prior programing language in intro), then
            in DBMS and then in OOPS. As I rated myself 9/10 in OOPS so, he asked me to tell all features of OOPS and
            explain them one by one with practical importance.<br>
            iii) One coding question he gave to me by sharing a link. I have to browse it and a code editor will open
            whose screen is sharable to interviewer and he also able to access it simultaneously. The question is: An
            array was given of size n, we have to print it's sum by taking following points into consideration: 1)
            Compute all numbers sum except the numbers comes b/w no. 6 and no. 9 inclusive.
            2) If no 9 occur after 6 then compute sum of all the numbers and if 9 occurs before 6 then also do the same.
            Else do follow condition one.<br>
            He suggested me to use only one loop for iteration. I did it by storing sum into two variables and
            exchanging them on the basis of occurrence of 6 and 9.<br>
            iv) My last question was on SQL query, it was: write a query to fetch employee count from employee table
            where department name is in department table and department id is in employee table. Basically he wants me
            to use aggregate function and join with group by clause.<br>
            <b>Technical Interview 2 :</b>(Same day in few hours later from Interview 1): As follows:<br>
            i). How was first interview explain it.<br>
            ii). Again one coding question he gave to me by sharing a link. I have to browse it and a code editor will
            open whose screen is sharable to interviewer and he also able to access it simultaneously, same process as
            previous round. Question is: Count the occurrence of alphabets from a string considering upper and lower
            case the same and print the histogram on the basis of their occurrence count in star pattern form. <br>
            iii). Do you know DBMS and SQL, I said yes: Then he asked -&gt; What is Index<br>
            Diff b/w DML and DDL<br>
            What is view<br>
            Will you insert row in view.<br>
            After Answering all his questions. He asked me how you keep your learnings up to date and then about ready
            to come at location which is Hyderabad and Mumbai.<br>

        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            <b>Round 1 :</b> It was conducted on Eduthrill platform of Accolite. It had aptitude questions, questions on
            Computer Science subjects like Operating Systems, Computer Networks, DBMS. Each test had 5 questions for
            which 5 minutes of time was given and a student is expected to give at least 20 tests with a minimum of 60%
            accuracy in each.<br><br>

            <b>Round 2 :</b> The second round is a coding challenge consisting of 1 question to be solved in 1 hour. The
            questions are basically hard but the good part is you can be selected for the next round even if you
            partially solved it.<br><br <b="">Round 3 : It was the technical round. I was asked a lot of problem solving
            questions like: find the maximum possible common substring, find the faulty stack of coins from the given
            stacks of coins, second largest occurrence count, largest palindromic substring. Each time I proposed a
            solution, I was asked any other optimized way to reduce complexities. Then I was asked some questions
            related to binary search tree and AVL Tree. Post this, the topic was changed to database and I was asked to
            write queries involving joins and sub - query concept. The complete interview lasted for about 45-50
            minutes. I was also asked about my projects and some other theory related questions.<br><br>

            <b>Round 4 :</b> It was another technical round. Unlike my previous round, this round was a theory based for
            me. It started with my introduction and then I was asked questions on topics like: Singleton Design Pattern,
            Anonymous class and interface, significance and uses of interface, multithreading, tomcat, final keyword,
            method overloading and overriding, compiler vs interpreter, OSI Layer, Annotations, Autoboxing, Immutable
            class. I was asked to write a piece of code for almost every topic. This round also lasted for around 50-60
            minutes.<br><br>

            <b>Technical Round :</b>
            They asked me to explain my latest project followed by the technologies and cost of that project. meanwhile,
            I mentioned my favorite language as java.
            Then he asked me some questions from java<br>
            1) when the memory for a static property is allocated<br>
            2) Collection classes hierarchy<br>
            3) When did you use heap or give me some examples where we prefer to use heap.<br><br>

            It was great experience with GROWW it took 2 weeks (4 rounds) to complete the interview process.<br><br>
            The first round was related to various technologies and Data Structures (Java Script, React JS &amp; Node
            JS). Everything was asked in detail. The interviewer also went through my projects on GitHub repo and walked
            through the code. If your basics are clear then only you will be able to answer the questions.<br><br>
            The second round was data structures, algorithms and puzzle round. He asked me 2 questions on the linked
            list and array,one puzzle and find the time complexity of the algorithm. It is all about 120 questions thats
            I practiced at hacker rank and leetcode.<br><br>
            The third round was again on advanced topics of Javascript, React JS and Algorithms, I was told to write the
            pseudo-code and optimize it. He asked number of questions but I answered few of them, it is not necessary to
            answer all the questions, if you don't know the answer just say <b>NO</b>, don't fabricate answers.<br><br>
            The fourth round was a normal discussion with the CTO/CEO, about the previous company and how I started
            coding. He was also interested in my projects as they were deployed and available online. He was shocked
            when I told that I have learned c/c++ in one year and JavaScript in 2 weeks.<br><br>

            I realised that four things matter the most - Basics, Data Structures, good set of PROJECTS and you should
            be able to communicate your thoughts. If you have this, then you can crack any interview.

            concept of java and c++. The interviewer just wants to check my problem solving skills, basic knowledge of

            Mailmodo is a banglore based startup who were looking for interns for front-end development.
            I applied through flipr.ai whose services were hired by mailmodo to help them find the
            appropriate candidate. I was shortlisted for interview based on my resume.
            The whole process consisted of four interviews.<br><br>
            The first interview was just about showcasing the projects I have built.<br><br>
            The interviewer was from flipr.ai and asked some project based questions which were fairly
            easy to answer. The interview went on for about 15 minutes in which I showed him two projects.
            One built using react and the other one using python.<br><br>
            Later that evening I received an email
            that I have cleared the first round and the next round which is going to be a technical interview
            was scheduled for that night.<br><br>
            The second interview was a technical interview which was also conducted by flipr.<br>
            Majorly the questions were related to javascript and react. Some questions which I remember are:<br>
            What are promises ?<br>
            What is a pure component in react?<br>
            What is virtual DOM?<br>
            The last part of this interview tested my problem solving skills as he gave me coding question and I
            had to tell him the way to solve it. Two days later I received an email that I have cleared the
            second round and the third round will be conducted by mailmodo .<br><br>

            The platform for third interview was an online shared coding environment. This interview was conducted
            by a member of mailmodo team. It was also a coding round which I had to solve in any language.
            The question was of intermediate level but I was able to solve it with his hints here and there.
            At the end he told me that I have cleared this round and the final interview will be conducted in
            2 days.<br><br>

            The final round was conducted on the same platform and the duration of this interview was just
            more than an hour. He started with questions on HTML and CSS along with some practical tasks like
            centering an element and changing the background. Then we moved onto javascript which took most
            of the interview where he asked in-depth questions about floating point precision ,scope, etc.<br>
            Then he asked about react.js and redux which were simple to answer. The last question was an
            aptitude question based on speed,time and distance. This concluded my final interview and
            I received a call in the evening saying I have been selected as an intern and after two months
            working as intern I received pre-placement offer from the company .

            I got the interview through the online coding competition Codevita.<br>
            I solved two questions and one of them was really easy but the other one was tricky<br>
            During the interview process there were three people in the panel. They told me to tell something
            about myself. I told them about my college and the languages I know (C, C++, Java, Python) and
            some web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React). I also told them about my
            hobbies and my technical blog on React. Then they asked me my preferred language (I said Java).<br>
            They asked me about constructors in Java (which was a good start since I had memorized the entire essay on
            constructors).
            Then they asked about super keyword, access specifiers, polymorphism, overloading and overriding,
            inheritance and told me to write an example of inheritance on paper and explain it. They went on to
            ask about initializer block. They told me to explain a project in Java.<br>
            I explained the Customer Management System which was created in three different layers: Data Layer, Business
            Layer and Presentation Layer.
            I explained it in detail and there were no follow up questions. About python they asked if I knew
            decorators.
            I told them the basic definition and that I don't know much about them. He asked me can you write
            basic SQL queries, I told him yes and he believed me and didn't tell me to write anything. Then the
            other person on the panel asked me to name some html tags and some attributes of img tag. <br>And he
            asked if I knew any of the modern technologies like ML, AI, IOT etc. Although I did know a little about ML
            and IOT, I wasn't confident so I told him I've just started to learn about them. He asked where do
            I see myself in the next five years whether or not I got selected in TCS. <br>I said if I got selected I
            want to be at a higher position and be good at my job and if I don't I'll try for the job by taking a
            year off. He also asked whether I want to work with the technologies I do know or want to learn new
            ones. I said I'm excited to chisel the knowledge I have now and learn all the new things.<br>
            Then the third person asked basic HR questions where do you live and do you have any problems
            with night duty and where you'll be located(I said no problem). She also asked nowadays student do
            online courses to learn ML, AI etc. , aren't you interested in learning about them?<br>
            I told her that I thought I should work on my basics first like revising what I already know,
            aptitude, competitive coding, but now I will do these courses. She asked whether I knew about
            the difference between ninja and digital role so I said a little bit. <br>So she said we are
            considering you for the ninja role are you okay with it? I said I am but I really wanted to learn
            about the modern technologies and expand my horizons. They asked me about my plans for higher studies.
            I said as of now I don't plan on it. She asked me what I do in my leisure time so I told them about
            my hobbies. Overall the interview went pretty smoothly but I certainly didn't have any idea I
            would be offered the digital role.

            Test consisted of aptitude questions (Quant, Verbal and Logical). Though questions were simple but given
            time was very less so you have to be real quick.<br>
            After that there was JAM(Just a minute) round, in this topic is given and everyone has one minute time to
            prepare for it and then one has to speak on that. This was major elimination round and therefore strong
            communication skills are required to crack this round.<br>
            Then came the technical interview, firstly the interviewee asked me to explain my projects. I explained two
            of them, one was Creating Web Services Framework. He was highly impressed by this as this was something
            different . Then there were cross questions related to project and multiple questions on Core Java, J2EE ,
            DBMS and JavaScript. <br>
            Other project was Video Subtitling. In the I had used Google Speech API, so the interviewer was interested
            to know the internal working of it, I told him that I was not knowing the answer, and he was happy with it.
            <br>
            Similarly some security related questions were also asked. The good part was that I worked hard on projects
            and prepared well in context to explaining them, this helped me a lot.<br>
            Then was the HR Round and the main focus was on why being an electronics and telecommunication engineer I
            wanted to join IT Sector and some other standard HR question's. <br>
            I found the interviewers to be very experienced people and one cannot fool them so you shoud be very honest

        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            I tried to approach a recruiter on LinkedIn last year. I had mailed her like 3-4 times with my portfolio and
            a recent project that I built.<br>
            One month ago, I received a message on LinkedIn from the same recruiter that she would like to start the
            screening process for ASE position at Red Hat<br><br>

            There were 2 interviews involved.
            <b>1. DS &amp; Algorithms Round</b><br>
            The interviewer asked me 2 questions and a puzzle. First question was related to dynamic programming and the
            other one was of DFS. I was able to solve both the questions but couldn't solve the puzzle.<br>
            The interviewer also asked me about the things that I mentioned in my resume, especially projects, skills
            and recent internship experience which were aligning with the job role.<br>
            <b>2. Technical Round</b><br>
            It was mostly about the skills on my resume that were aligning with there requirement. The interview was a
            casual conversation mostly about dockerfiles, kubernetes and containerization, since the team was working on
            a project called openshift which is an open source substitute for the popular paid containerization
            softwares.
            The interviewer also asked me about the open source culture and my contributions which were none and also
            about how comfortable I was with GitHub. Communication and general knowledge about current trends in the
            industry was key in this round
            The process took 2 weeks.

            in which I had to fill information, in which lot of my background details were required.
            After some days, they sent me a mail regarding an aptitude test.<br>
            <b>Aptitude test</b><br>
            They took my test on google meet, in which I had to attempt 6 questions,
            I had to write whole solutions and give them picture of whole solution.
            Actually, they were not interested in answer, but how I arrived to the solutions
            My 5 questions were correct. So they selected me for next round which was supposed to be a technical
            interview followed by HR interview.<br>
            <b>Technical Interview</b><br>
            They asked me some basic questions on c++ and on some of my projects.<br>

            They are very impressed with my work on IOT, which according to me wast not of great standard, but still
            they got the impression of my knowledge level in context to IOT.<br>
            After that they asked to me, that in how many days, you can learn c# and .Net framework. I said withing 2 to

            Then after 3-4 hours, I got mail of offer letter and they said me to join as soon as possible,
            as their work is on embedded system, so I cannot do work from home, but they said they will
            provide free accommodation and food. After that, I accepted the offer.

            strings and patterns. <br>
            Questions were as follows:<br>
            1) Check whether the string is a anagram or not.<br>

        <b style="font-size:14pt">Interview questions / experience</b>
        <p style="font-size:14pt;text-align:justify">
            Xoriant came to our college for a pool campus drive. There were a total of four rounds and each
            round was a knockout round. First round was online test. There were multiple choice questions of
            aptitude, logical reasoning, verbal, comprehension (coding language and company management based),
            technical questions(Data-structure, DBMS, Operating System and Computer Networking based) and two
            coding questions. Aptitude, logical reasoning and verbal sections were of moderate difficulty, but
            the comprehension part was quite tricky. The technical questions were quite hard, in most of the
            questions we have to find the complexity and the other questions from DBMS, Data Structure, Operating System
            and
            Computer Networking were more than one correct multiple choice questions. In coding section there were
            two questions and we could choose any of the language from C, C++, Java and Python. I opted for Java.
            There was a bit difference between the difficulty level of both the questions, the first question was
            quite easy as compared to the second which was of moderate level. For each question we were allowed
            only to compile maximum of three times and if we fail to produce correct output in all three chances, the
            code gets automatically submitted and we are switched to the next coding question.
            Second round was a Technical Interview. It was about 70 to 80 minutes long. There was only one
            interviewer, I was first asked to introduce myself. After that we started discussion on the projects that
            I mentioned in my resume. I was asked only about the tools and technologies that I used for these
            projects along with how it works. Then I was given with a coding question to solve, but I was free to
            choose any language of my choice to code, I chose java. It was a simple question where I was asked to
            write a function which accepts a string(number separated with commas, example "10,6,12,13,5") and
            that function should return a Integer Array that contains these all numbers but in a sorted form.
            After that I was asked questions from java and python, all the questions were coding based. Most of
            them were from Interface, Multi-threading, Inheritance, packaging and sorting algorithms. After that
            we switched to DBMS. I was asked about database connection, difference between SQL and NoSQL and
            connection pooling. Then I was asked to write queries for the problems, there main focus was to know
            use of Select, Join, Limit and Count. After that basic theory questions of React was asked like why to
            use ReactJS?, components of ReactJS and advantages of ReactJS. This finishes the Technical Interview.
            After that I was having HR Interview. It started with my introduction along with some questions like justify
            your strength and weakness, why I opted for Computer Science and Engineering, about my training and
            internship
            experience and so on. It was about 25 to 30 minutes long.
            At last there was Managerial Interview. It was taken by one of the project manager from Xoriant.
            I was asked about the training and internships that I had done and my role in the team. After that I was
            asked
            to explain my all project in detail. Then we discussed about the current project that I was doing as
            Major Project and some puzzles and their implementation in programming. It was about 30 to 40
            minutes long. After one week of Managerial Interview, I received my offer letter from Xoriant.

            minutes less in my coding section. Due to pandemic test happened virtually so TCS
